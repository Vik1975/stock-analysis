# stock-analysis
Work Done:
Created a script that looped through all the stocks for one year and outputed the following information:

- The ticker symbol

- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

Moderated solution

Added functionality to my script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".


Made the appropriate adjustments to my VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

Conditional formatting made that  highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red.
